# TU Dublin Semantic Web Module

[Module Descriptor](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VlnS-kbH59NmU22s9e0SgaoSJZIFlQmV/view)

This module covers the rationale, techniques and application of Semantic Web technologies, such as ontologies,
knowledge bases and knowledge graphs.
The aim is to give an introduction to Semantic Web technologies and their applications. The main goal of the
Semantic Web is in semantic representation and reasoning of data using ontologies. Thus, it delves into different
aspects of ontology representation, creation, design, reasoning, programming and applications throughout the
module.

## Lecture Notes

- **Introduction to Semantic Web and Vision:** Introduction to the idea of Semantic Web, overview of available technologies, Semantic Web layers and architectures.
- **Languages:** RDF, RDFS, OWL: Describing Web resources, Resource Description Framework, data model, syntax, RDF Schema, axiomatic semantics, Web Ontology Language, requirements for ontology languages, compatibility.
- **Ontology Design and Management:** constructing ontologies, reusing existing ontologies, semi-automatic ontology acquisition, ontology mapping, exposing relational databases, ontology editors and tools.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** modelling graphs, wikidata, complexity and expressivity.
- **Reasoning:** logic and inference, monotonic rules syntax and semantics, predicate logic, formal logic, description logic, rule interchange format.
- **Querying with SPARQL:** Rules in SPARQL, SPARQL query development, Rule ML, querying joined graphs.
- **Semantic Web Programming:** Semantic data, expressing meaning, RDFlib, linked data, publishing semantic data, toolkits.
- **Current Applications of the Semantic Web:** application architecture, goodrelations, government data, sig.ma and sindice, OpenCalais, schema.org, best practice implementations and applications in production.
